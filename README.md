# fileParserTaskHicx

**Instructions**
The application can be run on your IDE terminal, simply:
1) unzip the folder
2) open the application on your IDE
3) edit configuration by putting a valid folder path (path can be a string) into your environment variable, the path will
   be the folder that the application will be observing as it runs.
4) run the application from your IDE

**Packages**

The Simple file parser application has a package called interfaces that houses all interfaces. The
interfaces provide the application, the ability to scale up it's implementations for statistics and fileManagers or fileParsers
The application has a fileManagers package that houses all the implementations of the different
possible types of file parsers that will cater for different file extensions.
The application has a Statistics package that houses all the implementations of the classes or
potential classes responsible for calculating the different types of statistics.

**DirObserver**
The directory observer class is responsible for watching a directory and ensuring that whenever a
create event is triggered on the directory, the application knows and carries out certain tasks on
the file that was added.
the directory observer has a method that starts observing the directory provided in the environment variable when invoked and
another that stops observing the directory when invoked.

**fileManagers**
This package houses implementations of the FileManager interface, it houses only the _TextManager_ class at the moment, but
can house other implementations that will cater for parsing the contents of other file types into string values which will
then be processed to show statistics of the file content.
The fileManagers also implement methods for moving files from a folder to another folder.

**Statistics**
This package houses classes that provide method implementations that perform statistic checks on
the files that are added to the folder being watched by the file observer.
There are implementations for number of dots (_numDotsStatistics_ class), number of words(_numWordsStatistics_ class),
most used word statistics (_mostUsedWordStatistics_ class) these implementations are used in the directory observer
startObserving method to provide statistics for every file that is added to the folder.

**Model--> StatisticsModel**
The Model package basically houses any model that the application may need, for now it has just the Statistics Model.
The Statistics Model basically serves as the return type for all statistic implementations, it gives the application
the feature of displaying statistics based on the statistic type, it collects the stat to be displayed and the value of the stat
for that file as part of its constructor.
